# Lessons I learned

- Before writing a single line of code for a project this big, map out
  what the general process will look like. Doesn't have to be perfect or
  extensive, but something tangible. Writing code is the fun part, but
  writing code without direction leads to technical debt fast. That isn't
  so fun to manage.

- Move at a sustainable pace. Moving fast does indeed get things
  done fast, especially with AI assistance, but it also becomes
  unmanageable just as quick.

- Write tests early and often. That way there isn't any question of
  whether refactoring breaks something. Also helps as a sanity check - if a
  function isn't easily testable, maybe it needs to be split up or changed
  in some way.

- Always remain the driver. AI is a clever follower, but not a good
  leader.

- AI is no replacement for a human brain, but it is genuinely useful
  for some things. Somewhere in between the extremes of "completely
  useless" and "completely obsoletes programming".

- It really is okay to write code that isn't perfect in some situations.
  Sometimes that's how you learn new things: by making mistakes. Who cares
  if it's good enough for random strangers on the Internet - is it good
  enough for you? Was it a valuable experience that you gained something
  from? As long as it's not going to be part of critical infrastructure or
  something, then whatever, right? Life is messy. The die-hard code
  correctness people do have a point and everything, and it's okay to just
  tinker with things too. Both can be true and have value.
